  <h2 id="fitbit-more-like-sleepbit">Fitbit? More like Sleepbit</h2>

<p>My amazing girlfriend once had a great idea for a Christmas gift - a small Fitbit. She also got one, which helped us stay fit by encouraging each other to beat each other’s stats. A great side effect I discovered only later on is that wearing the Fitbit every day for 1.5 years generated tons of detailed sleep tracking data. And I really mean <em>tons</em>.</p>

<p>The next thing was to get all that data. Knowing how companies tend to make their products as limited as possible in terms of access to your own data, I didn’t have much hope. However, it turns out that Fitbit allows you to export all of your data in… JSON and CSV formats! What a news was that to me!</p>

<h2 id="exploration-time">Exploration time!</h2>

<p>To uncover what my sleep data tries to tell me, I did an in-depth analysis of 1.5 years’ worth of data. <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/slazien/fitbit_analysis/4140b6c56bfb1b448364fc58344d23383c86e387?filepath=notebooks%2Fmain_analysis.ipynb">An interactive Jupyter notebook is available here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="main-conclusions">Main conclusions</h3>

<p>My analysis:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Seems to confirm that going to sleep on time improves sleep quality.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Confirms my feeling of “not being a dreamer” - I regularly get less REM sleep than I should for my age. This will have to be further diagnosed by a sleep doctor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Confirms that I’m a “light sleeper” quite literally - the vast majority of my sleep stages are light sleep, sometimes to the point of being disproportionately frequent. This partially explains my occasional tiredness during the day.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shows that the duration of a single deep sleep episode as well as the total deep sleep time per night is highly variable, which helps explain days where I feel very refreshed one day and tired the next one.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Overall, this was a great exercise in data wrangling and using using Plotly to make interactive graphs. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!</p>
