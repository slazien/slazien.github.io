  <h2 id="more-questions-than-answers">More questions than answers</h2>
<p>Not too long ago, I took a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being">happiness course</a> on coursera - “The science of well-being” by Laurie Santos. It is a fantastic, eye-opening course about what <em>actually</em> makes us happy, as opposed to what our brains make us <em>think</em> makes us happy.</p>

<p>After taking the course, lots of questions naturally came to mind: are all people happy on more or less the same level around the world? Does money <em>really</em> not make us happy? Can we predict collective happiness levels of societies by looking at suicide rates? All questions, no answers.</p>

<h2 id="data-to-the-rescue">Data to the rescue</h2>
<p>Naturally, to have a go at answering these, I had to find relevant data. The <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mathurinache/world-happiness-report">World Happiness Report data</a> looked great for my purpose. I also found a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016">suicide rates overview dataset</a> which I later merged with the happiness one. Data cleaning clearly took the longest due to some inconsistencies and missing data in several datasets. However, afterwards, it was mostly smooth sailing.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/slazien/happiness_analysis/blob/master/happiness.ipynb">The complete analysis of both datasets is here - have a look if you want to dive deeper into the methods used and see the graphs.</a></strong></p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>All in all, the data mostly supported what I learned in the course, and gave me some answers to my questions. The most important conclusions are:</p>

<p><strong>1. Money is not as important as we think in making us happy</strong></p>

<p><strong>2. Good relationships and good health are important contributors to our happiness</strong></p>

<p><strong>3. The degree to which you’re happy / likely to commit a suicide varies considerably with where you live in the world</strong></p>

<p><strong>4. High / low suicide rates don’t imply low / high happiness scores. In other words - suicide rates are poor predictors of happiness</strong></p>

<p>Now go talk to your family and friends, have a walk in the nature or have a run - this is almost sure to make you more happy :)</p>
