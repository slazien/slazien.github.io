title: A quantitative look at happiness
---

## More questions than answers
Not too long ago, I took a [happiness course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being) on coursera - "The science of well-being" by Laurie Santos. It is a fantastic, eye-opening course about what *actually* makes us happy, as opposed to what our brains make us *think* makes us happy.

After taking the course, lots of questions naturally came to mind: are all people happy on more or less the same level around the world? Does money *really* not make us happy? Can we predict collective happiness levels of societies by looking at suicide rates? All questions, no answers.

## Data to the rescue
Naturally, to have a go at answering these, I had to find relevant data. The [World Happiness Report data](https://www.kaggle.com/mathurinache/world-happiness-report) looked great for my purpose. I also found a [suicide rates overview dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016) which I later merged with the happiness one. Data cleaning clearly took the longest due to some inconsistencies and missing data in several datasets. However, afterwards, it was mostly smooth sailing.

**[The complete analysis of both datasets is here - have a look if you want to dive deeper into the methods used and see the graphs.](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/slazien/happiness_analysis/blob/master/happiness.ipynb)**

## Conclusions
All in all, the data mostly supported what I learned in the course, and gave me some answers to my questions. The most important conclusions are:

**1. Money is not as important as we think in making us happy**

**2. Good relationships and good health are important contributors to our happiness**

**3. The degree to which you're happy / likely to commit a suicide varies considerably with where you live in the world**

**4. High / low suicide rates don't imply low / high happiness scores. In other words - suicide rates are poor predictors of happiness**

Now go talk to your family and friends, have a walk in the nature or have a run - this is almost sure to make you more happy :)
