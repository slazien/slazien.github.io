title: Another attempt at a personal blog
---

This is my _n_<sup>th</sup> attempt at consistently keeping a personal blog up-to-date. Trying this out several years ago I failed, which taught me several lessons that will, hopefully, make things better this time:

- **Keeping it simple.** My old personal website was too complicated to update. Say hi to procrastination.
- **Staying focused.** What is my goal with a personal blog? I didn't use to have a clear goal, which means I didn't have an incentive to keep it up to date.
- **Keeping records of my learning helps with motivation.** This is tied to the previous point. I want to have some sort of a virtual "diary" where I note down what I learned. *"Use a personal notepad like Joplin"*, I hear you say. The issue is - my notes tend to become messy, and by expecting *some* visitors, it makes me think twice (* 10) before publishing. *Does it have any value to the reader?*, *Is it easily comprehensible?* are just a couple of questions that I hope will improve my writing skills. As an aspiring Data Scientist, being a good writer is arguably a crucial skill.

And... that's about it! I have kept it short this time to make sure that I can get started with *something*, however small (thanks *Atomic Habits*).
