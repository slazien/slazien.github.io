## Who am I?
Hi, I'm Przemek! I've graduated from the University of Southampton, majoring in Physical Geography. Ever since taking a class on hypothesis testing in R at the university, I got hooked on all things data science. Why? In my view, data science is a great set of tools to help us objectively analyze and understand the world around us. Things like geopolitics, public health, or weather can all be better understood by taking raw data, giving it a hard look, and using it to answer our questions.

## What do I do?
I am currently an MS in Analytics student at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.analytics.gatech.edu/). Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I was a Senior Solutions Engineer at [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/). I decided to pursue a graduate degree mainly because it is an intellectually satisfying experience and it will considerably improve my skills, allowing me to improve my odds of a fulfilling and impactful career as a Data Scientist and expand my network.

## What do I do when not any of the above?
I enjoy working out (calisthenics), [photography](https://www.instagram.com/slazien/), learning about value investing, psychology, maths, and [many other subjects](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66808788-slazien).

I also enjoy tracking various aspects of my health (notably: heart rate, sleeping patterns) and tweaking my daily life to improve upon these. I believe that regular analysis of such data will allow me to maintain / keep improving my health and live longer. There is no better reward I could think of.
