## Who am I?
Hi, I'm Przemek! I've graduated from the University of Southampton, majoring in Physical Geography. Ever since taking a class on hypothesis testing in R at the university, I got hooked on all things data science. Why? In my view, data science is a great set of tools to help us objectively analyze and understand the world around us. Things like geopolitics, public health, or weather can all be better understood by taking raw data, giving it a hard look, and using it to answer our questions.
